\section*{Global domain}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Global domain class (more details!)
    \item References to patches
    \item \textbf{Question:} What about the mappings? How are they represented?
            How regular are they? Where are they defined?
    \item \textbf{Question:} What patches should we use? Should the upper patch
            be split?
    \item identify edges and corners of different edges (Do we need to identify
        corners of same patch?)
\end{itemize}
