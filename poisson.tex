\section{Poisson problem on multipatch}
\begin{align*}
    -\nabla \cdot \nu \nabla \phi = \rho
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Question:} Does the advection field $\mathbf{A}$ have to be
            continuous? Emily thinks so. Then we need to enforce global $C^1$-regularity on $\phi$ 
    \item Use CONGA approach with $C^1$ conforming projection $\rightarrow$ 
            need the mesh information and spline coefficients from neighboring mesh
            to construct 
    \item spline coefficients of $\rho$ needed to assemble rhs
    \item Poisson solver needs to access all spline coefficients from all patches
            $\rightarrow$ need global managing of the splines, mesh etc 
            to assemble everything
    \item \textbf{Question:} Do the mappings matter? It should still be local 
            averages of spline coefficients to compute the projections...
    \item \textbf{Question:}Do we make the assembly of the stiffness matrix completely global?
\end{itemize}
